TODO
====

* Add a way to print orginal input text (line), from some token
    * Dynamic linewise path cache for bidirgen wrapper
        * Some test function which breaks/limits caching
        * Tests for bidirgen
* Add ignore token tables (ignore tokens already implemented).
    * Is this really needed, what is the use case?
* Check if it were possible to attain python2 compatibility.
* maybe support named subvalues for tokens?
* Add more tests as always.
